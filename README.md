## About the hackathon

 ### Description: 
 The goal is to identify changes in Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery. 
 The complexity of the exercises will depend on the audience skills.
 
 ### Tentative Agenda:
     
* 1.[Introduction](./introduction.ipynb)
     
* 2.[Introduction to SAR image formation and differences with Optical Data](./introductionSAR.ipynb)
     
* 3.[Change Detection with SAR imagery](./acd.ipynb)

* 4.[Thresholding techniques](./thresholding.ipynb)
     
* 5.[Postprocessing](./postprocessing.ipynb)
     
* 6.[Series of data](./series.ipynb)
 
 
 ### Requirements:Â 
 This [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#what-is-a-binder) repository was set up so that you can participate with no pre-requirement to be installed on your side.
 However, the notebook must target a computing environment with 2 GB of RAM. After some inactivity, the docker container is culled. Access to a web browser should be enough for your successful participation.
 
 ### Target Participants: 
 Students, Software developers, Data scientists, EO-developers, anyone with an interest in the topic.
 
 ### Time requirements: 
 
 Half day (4 hours)
